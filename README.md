# fit-connect-rs

## Description 

Right now this is a POC of an application that will eventually pull data from various fitness sources, export it or sync it to other fitness tools.
Currently, all it does is uses the [withings-rs](https://github.com/qgriffith/withings-rs) rust crate to pull the last weight and sync 
it to strava using the [strava-rs](https://github.com/qgriffith/strava-client-rs) crate.
